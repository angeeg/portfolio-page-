        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
            My name is Angeleena and I am currently a student in the coding bootcamp at UC Berkley Extension.
            Coding is a fairly new realm for me but I have learned in my short experience that it is something 
            I enjoy and something that I am good at. I am a fast learner and an ambitious, hard worker. 
            Any challenge I am faced with I will conquer, regardless of what obstacles may get in my way. 
        </br></br>
            I work hard not only myself and my employer, but for my family. My husband and I share an amost
            three year old daughter, Elliana, and a seven year old pit-bull, Lula. They are our entire world.
            My past work experience includes being a line cook for just over three years, and most recently a veterinary technician
            for the past six years. Although I have a deep passion for animals it is not someting that I could make a career for 
            the main goals I have in life. However, I still pursue that passion part time. I give my full attention 
            to whatever developing project is due. 
         </br></br>
            I hope to meet you someday soon and show you who I truly am through my developing skills
            and create for you exactly what you ask for. 

        </p>
