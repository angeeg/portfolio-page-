# Command Line

In this activity, you will use the command line to create files and folders, open and edit the files, and remove files and folders.

## Instructions

Using only the command line:

1. Create a new folder titled `my-awesome-project`.
<!-- mkdir my-awsome-project-->

2. Create a new Markdown file titled `README.md`.
<!-- touch README.md -->

3. Open `README.md` in your IDE and add a top-level header that reads: "My Awesome Project". Don't forget to save!

4. Copy `README.md` to the inside of `my-awesome-project`.
<!-- cp README.md my-awesome-project/README.md -->

5. Delete the original `README.md` file.
<!-- rm README.md -->
<!-- there is a README.md inside of the my-awesome-project folder -->

6. Delete the `my-awesome-project` folder.
<!-- rmdir  -->
<!-- rm -r deletes a folder with files within it -->
